Steps
 1.	Place the ice cream, milk, and chocolate syrup into the blender. If using chocolate chips, add those as well. Be mindful that the harder the ice cream is, the better, as the blending process can liquefy the ice cream too much and make the milkshake too thin.
 2.	Blend the ingredients until completely smooth.
 3.	Pour into your glasses immediately, top with whipped cream, and decorate with shaved chocolate. Enjoy!
